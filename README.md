SnakeEyes was created late in the 2017 offseason, and is far from completion. In the end, it is intended to provide common, reusable vision utilities (such as data and video streaming, config, etc.) for custom vision code. Deviating from previous years, and attempting to standardize our codebase, this is also written in Kotlin (as opposed to C++ or Python from 2017 or 2016). Despite its similarity in name to SnakeSkin, it does not provide a DSL, but instead many utility classes that can be used in any way needed. Currently SnakeEyes offers tiling picture-in-picture view and configurable targeting crosshairs.
